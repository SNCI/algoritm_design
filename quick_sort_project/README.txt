Obviously don't look at my_quick_sort.py or tools.py as those contain 
implementations 

Tests for quick sort and the functions that make up quick sort

I suggest you keep the names function names as they are
see the __init__.py file at the base of quick_sort for how to do this

These tests assume the return value from quick_sort is a
a tuple(list, int)/(sorted_list, comparisons), if your function does it some
you will have to change them around
