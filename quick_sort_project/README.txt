For the tests look in the tests_quick_sort directory

I suggest you keep the names function names as they are
see the __init__.py file at the base of quick_sort for how to do this


These tests assume the return value from quick_sort is a
a tuple(list, int)/(sorted_list, comparisons), if your function does it some
other way, you will have to make changes

If you have nosetest installed run it from the base of test directory
