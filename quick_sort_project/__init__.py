# here is where you replace names

from my_quick_sort import quick_sort as quick_sort
from my_quick_sort import  partition as partition
from tools import file_to_list as file_to_list
from tools import median_of_three
from tools import first
from tools import last
# so for example if your file is called QS and you named your function 
# super_sort then it would be
# from QS import super_sort as quick_sort
